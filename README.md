### Hi, I'm Lukasz

I'm a London based, established contractor, proud ASPIE with love for new technologies 👨‍💻.

Most of my code is private but the bits which are public are free for grabs.

### Languages and technologies I work with

Golang 🥰 Python 🔥 Ruby 💎 (and quite rusty PHP, Java, C)

🌟 Docker Kubernetes Terraform Ansible 🌟

☁️ Going cloudy? I love AWS and GoogleCloud (and sometimes even Azure)
